# hei-cmd

This is a command-line application for interfacing with the [Hei library](https://github.com/QuartermindGames/hei).
This tool was originally part of Hei, but I've decided to move it out into its own separate utility just to make it more accessible as not too many people were probably aware of it.

## What can it do?

- You can convert or bulk images between different formats
- You can extract or bulk extract obscure package formats
- You can convert or bulk convert models between different formats
- List the contents of obscure package formats
- Load plugins to support other formats or add other utilities

While probably not especially useful features on their own, the strength in all of this is through the formats that Hei supports.

## What formats does it support?

This is mostly covered in the main Hei repository [here](https://github.com/QuartermindGames/hei) though there are some extra formats here that aren't supported per the main Hei library.
